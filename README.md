# mail-parser
mail-parser goes beyond being just a simple wrapper for the Python Standard Library's [email module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/email.message.html). It seamlessly transforms raw emails into versatile Python objects that you can integrate effortlessly into your projects. As the cornerstone of [SpamScope](https://github.com/SpamScope/spamscope), mail-parser empowers you to handle emails with ease and efficiency.

Additionally, mail-parser supports the parsing of Outlook email formats (.msg). To enable this functionality on Debian-based systems, simply install the necessary package:

```
$ apt-get install libemail-outlook-message-perl
```

For further details about the package, you can run:

```
$ apt-cache show libemail-outlook-message-perl
```

mail-parser is fully compatible with Python 3, ensuring modern performance and reliability.

# Description
mail-parser takes a raw email as input and converts it into a comprehensive Python object that mirrors the structure of an email as defined by the relevant RFCs. Each property of this object directly maps to standard [RFC headers](https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml) such as "From", "To", "Cc", "Bcc", "Subject", and more.

In addition, the parser extracts supplementary components including:
- Plain text and HTML bodies for versatile processing.
- Attachments along with their metadata (e.g., filename, content type, encoding, and more).
- Detailed diagnostics like timestamp conversions, defects indicating non-compliant header formats, and custom header management (using underscore substitutions for hyphenated header names).

Moreover, each header and property is accessible in multiple formats:
- A native Python value for immediate use.
- A raw string to retain original formatting.
- A JSON representation for simplified integration with other tools or services.

This rich parsing capability makes mail-parser a robust tool for email processing, enabling developers to handle, analyze, and even troubleshoot raw email data with comprehensive detail.

  - bcc
  - cc
  - date
  - delivered_to
  - from\_ (not `from` because is a keyword of Python)
  - message_id
  - received
  - reply_to
  - subject
  - to

There are other properties to get:
  - body
  - body html
  - body plain
  - headers
  - attachments
  - sender IP address
  - to domains
  - timezone

The `attachments` property is a list of objects. Every object has the following keys:
  - binary: it's true if the attachment is a binary
  - charset
  - content_transfer_encoding
  - content-disposition
  - content-id
  - filename
  - mail_content_type
  - payload: attachment payload in base64

To get custom headers you should replace "-" with "\_".
Example for header `X-MSMail-Priority`:

```
$ mail.X_MSMail_Priority
```

The `received` header is parsed and splitted in hop. The fields supported are:
 - by
 - date
 - date_utc
 - delay (between two hop)
 - envelope_from
 - envelope_sender
 - for
 - from
 - hop
 - with


> **Important:** mail-parser can detect defects in mail.
  - [defects](https://docs.python.org/2/library/email.message.html#email.message.Message.defects): mail with some not compliance RFC part

All properties have a JSON and raw property that you can get with:
 - name_json
 - name_raw

Example:

```
$ mail.to (Python object)
$ mail.to_json (JSON)
$ mail.to_raw (raw header)
```

The command line tool use the JSON format.


## Defects and Their Impact on Email Security
Email defects, such as malformed boundaries, can be exploited by malicious actors to bypass antispam filters. For instance, a poorly formatted boundary in an email might conceal an illegitimate epilogue that contains hidden malicious content, such as malware payloads or phishing links.

mail-parser is built to detect these structural irregularities, ensuring that even subtle anomalies are captured and analyzed. By identifying these defects, the library provides an early warning system, allowing you to:

- Uncover hidden parts of an email that may be deliberately obfuscated.
- Diagnose potential security threats stemming from non-standard email formatting.
- Facilitate deeper forensic analysis of suspicious emails where the epilogue might carry harmful code or deceitful information.

This robust defect detection mechanism is essential for maintaining the integrity of your email processing systems and enhancing overall cybersecurity.

# Installation
To install mail-parser, follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to install mail-parser from PyPI:

```bash
$ pip install mail-parser
```

4. (Optional) To verify the installation, you can run:

```bash
$ pip show mail-parser
```

If you plan to contribute or develop further, consider setting up a `uv` environment and syncing all development dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SpamScope/mail-parser.git
$ cd mail-parser
$ uv sync
```

With these commands, youâ€™ll have all dependencies installed inside your virtual environment.

For more detailed instructions about `uv`, please refer to the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).


# Usage in a project
Import `mailparser` module:

```
import mailparser

mail = mailparser.parse_from_bytes(byte_mail)
mail = mailparser.parse_from_file(f)
mail = mailparser.parse_from_file_msg(outlook_mail)
mail = mailparser.parse_from_file_obj(fp)
mail = mailparser.parse_from_string(raw_mail)
```

Then you can get all parts

```
mail.attachments: list of all attachments
mail.body
mail.date: datetime object in UTC
mail.defects: defect RFC not compliance
mail.defects_categories: only defects categories
mail.delivered_to
mail.from_
mail.get_server_ipaddress(trust="my_server_mail_trust")
mail.headers
mail.mail: tokenized mail in a object
mail.message: email.message.Message object
mail.message_as_string: message as string
mail.message_id
mail.received
mail.subject
mail.text_plain: only text plain mail parts in a list
mail.text_html: only text html mail parts in a list
mail.text_not_managed: all not managed text (check the warning logs to find content subtype)
mail.to
mail.to_domains
mail.timezone: returns the timezone, offset from UTC
mail.mail_partial: returns only the mains parts of emails
```

It's possible to write the attachments on disk with the method:

```
mail.write_attachments(base_path)
```

# Usage from command-line
If you installed mailparser with `pip` or `setup.py` you can use it with command-line.

These are all swithes:

```
